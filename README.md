# GRADER PLEASE READ: 

***************************
All members of this group committed to the VersionControl7/kolorpitt github. This was done for the Version Control Lab last week. For reasons unclear, when completing the Plaintext lab, in the committing process for this lab, all documents got deleted except the Code-of-Conduct. I (Kathryn) re-committed all files that were deleted, and I could not find a proper means of restoring the repo to a previous history. If you check the reposit commit history, you will see that all members committed files of the same name and text content as I have reuploaded.

### Overview:
This repository stores code designed to take in String inputs of a user's names and generate output based on additional criteria (typically an integer). All code committed to this repository should contain an input function to allow users to submit a string to their program

```python
user_input = input("Here's where you'll enter your name: ")
```

Contributors have freedom to style how their name is printed or manipulated by the second input. Pull requests should be submitted to Kolorpitt.
